As some of you might have noticed RfK is offline.<br>
This is intended and no reason to worry besides that someone who calls himself <s>Anonymous Austria</s>Scriptkiddie broke into the database and might have had access to account information.<br>
Anyways, since RfK doesn't store any usefull information you should be safe...<br>
We are very sorry for the latest breach, and that we found ourself in the realms of Sony. If you have used your password on another site, you are hereby advised to change it.<br>
<br>
Since we don't have the time to fix MK III we've killed it in favor of the development of MK IV, which is a complete rewrite and shares no sourcecode with MK III.<br>
<br>
All in all, rewriting is a slow process and don't expect RfK to be back in the next two weeks.<br>
